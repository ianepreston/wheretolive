I wanted to find a good source to download elevation data to make commutes easier.
Unfortunately I couldn't find one that I could programmatically extract. Instead I found
a Canadian government site where I could formulate a specific request and then have it
emailed to me. Give this a shot: https://maps.canada.ca/czs/index-en.html
